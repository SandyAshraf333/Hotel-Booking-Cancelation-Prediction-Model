🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Model
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. Cancellations pose a significant challenge for the hospitality industry, impacting revenue, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. By building a predictive model, hotels can take proactive measures such as offering discounts, overbooking strategies, or sending reminders to reduce cancellations.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze hotel booking data to identify key factors influencing cancellations.

Preprocess and clean the dataset for accurate predictions.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for cancellation prediction.

Provide insights and recommendations for hotel management.

📂 Dataset

Source: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset (Kaggle / UCI)

Features include:

hotel (City Hotel / Resort Hotel)

lead_time (days before arrival booking was made)

arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month

stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights

adults, children, babies

meal, market_segment, distribution_channel

is_canceled (target variable: 1 = canceled, 0 = not canceled)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
