üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Model

üìå Overview

This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. Cancellations pose a significant challenge for the hospitality industry, impacting revenue, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. By building a predictive model, hotels can take proactive measures such as offering discounts, overbooking strategies, or sending reminders to reduce cancellations.

üéØ Objectives

Analyze hotel booking data to identify key factors influencing cancellations.

Preprocess and clean the dataset for accurate predictions.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for cancellation prediction.

Provide insights and recommendations for hotel management.

Features include:

hotel (City Hotel / Resort Hotel)

lead_time (days before arrival booking was made)

arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month

stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights

adults, children, babies

meal, market_segment, distribution_channel

is_canceled (target variable: 1 = canceled, 0 = not canceled)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Processing: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm

Model Evaluation: classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score

üîÑ Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand dataset, visualize patterns, check correlations.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize numerical data.

Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, create new ones if necessary.

Model Training: Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.

Model Evaluation: Compare performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

Deployment (optional): Export the trained model with pickle or joblib for integration into applications.
